		<item name="Student-Led Spring PHY 110C Courses" category="SPS Activities" deadline="Never">
			<info>It's official! The Department of Physics is offering two student-led
courses next semester as PHY 110C! Unique ID 58911 (Professor Sitz) is with SPS President, Evan Ott, and LaTeX master
Will Beason who will be leading an "Introduction to Data Analysis for Physics" course, geared as
preparation for PHY 355L (Modern Lab / Junior Lab) with &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://latex-project.org/intro.html"&gt;LaTeX&lt;/a&gt; and 
&lt;a href="http://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/" target="_blank"&gt;Mathematica&lt;/a&gt;. Unique ID 58913 (Professor Marder) is going to be led by Crystal Riley, on
an "Introduction to Programming for Physics" using &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.python.org/"&gt;Python&lt;/a&gt;, geared to introduce you to concepts in programming that you can
then apply in research or industry. Neither course presumes prior programming experience.

		<item name="Sunday Night Study Session" category="SPS Activities" deadline="Never">
			<date>Sundays, 6pm-???</date>
			<location>RLM 7.116</location>
			<info>It's back! Our Sunday Night Study Session (SNSS) is in full swing! For those who haven't been, every week we invite any and all physics majors and people in physics or math classes to come by to work on homework. With many upper-division students in attendance (and some LAs for classes), when you run into problems, you won't be stuck for long. We also provide cookies, coffee, tea, etc., to help keep you &lt;s&gt;caffeinated&lt;/s&gt; energized. Some come by to help or be helped! If you're interested in tutoring, making known that you're available during the night (name on a chalkboard) is a great way to earn service hours for Sigma Pi Sigma.</info>

		<item name="Service Hours" category="Sigma Pi Sigma" deadline="Never">
			<info>Interested in joining Sigma Pi Sigma, the physics honors society?
The requirements are listed on &lt;a target="_blank"
href="http://www.ph.utexas.edu/~sps/pages/EPE.html"&gt;our website&lt;/a&gt;. For the service
hour component, we will be managing that through the new HornsLink system (see below for the link).
Join the SPS group and when you volunteer (like tutoring for SNSS above), submit a request for
us to verify your service hours. That way,
we have a nice record of volunteers and volunteer time (and it will show up on the resume HornsLink
can create for you)! You input the time you worked, we sign off, then you don't have to think about it again!</info>
