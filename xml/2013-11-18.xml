			<info>It's back! Our Sunday Night Study Session (SNSS) is in full swing! For those who haven't been, every week we invite any and all physics majors and people in physics or math classes to come by to work on homework. With many upper-division students in attendance (and some LAs for classes), when you run into problems, you won't be stuck for long. We also provide cookies, coffee, tea, etc., to help keep you &lt;s&gt;caffeinated&lt;/s&gt; energized. Some come by to help or be helped! If you're interested in tutoring, making known that you're available during the night (name on a chalkboard) is a great way to earn service hours for Sigma Pi Sigma.</info>

				hour component, we will be managing that through the new HornsLink system (see below for the link).
				Join the SPS group and when you volunteer (like tutoring for SNSS above), submit a request for
				us to verify your service hours. That way,
				we have a nice record of volunteers and volunteer time (and it will show up on the resume HornsLink
				can create for you)! You input the time you worked, we sign off, then you don't have to think about it again!</info>
